# 🌱 Blobs – Procedural World Generator (Evolution Simulation Base)

**Blobs** is a tile-based procedural world generator written in Python using **Pygame** and **Perlin noise**.  
It creates a dynamic, resource-rich environment designed as the foundation for **evolution**, **AI behavior**, and **ecosystem simulations**.

This project focuses on:
- Procedural terrain generation  
- Environmental features  
- Renewable resources  
- Biomes and world diversity  
- Simple plant life with growth mechanics  
- An ideal base for creature evolution and emergent behaviors
